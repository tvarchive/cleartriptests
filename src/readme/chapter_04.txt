Moving on, let us abstract the driver from the test scenarios.

Principally, the scenario should just talk a business language and the browser driver(definition and instantiation) should be abstracted, so that
    there is a central place for everyone to go fetch a driver instance as needed.
    type for driver is abstracted to a common place and can be changed more easily if needed.


So we will move the driver definition to a separate class (AppDriver) and also instantiate it there.
So, moving forward any of the test scenario class that needs the driver would pick it up from the AppDriver class.


Now look again at the test scenario class.
    The scenarios can easily be modeled on the screens (pages) of the application. What we are precisely doing in these
     scenarios is the following.
        e.g. The user lands on the homepage of the website
             And he clicks the flight link on the homepage
             And then enter flight details on the flight search page
             And then clicks on search button on the flight search page
             Then he should see results of the search on search results pages.

     If you now look at the methods other than the test methods they are actually page specific steps. And these steps
     would obviously make sense to be abstracted because more than one test scenario would be going through all the pages
     where these steps belong to.


     So, in principle we should have pages defined in the framework. A page would collate all the steps that can be done
     on that particular page. And hence, providing a service to any test scenario that needs to interact with the page.
