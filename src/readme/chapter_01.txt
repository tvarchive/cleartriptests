This is a pre-recorded test mostly generated through selenium IDE.

And following is the scenario it covers:

Given the user is on cleartrip home page
When he searches with details for a one-way journey
Then he should get the outbound journey options

The @Test annotation signifies that the the method under consideration is a test method and can be run using TestNG
test framework.

We have just recorded one small ticket search flow using the Selenium IDE and pasted the generated code in here.

There are non-deterministic hard coded wait put in the tests to take care of the following:
    1. The autocomplete options to appear when the user starts typing the origin or destination city name.
    2. To ensure that the test waits for the result page to appear. While writing the test we noticed that the pageLoad
    on search button click was a little inconsistent and the test kept failing randomly.

Problem with the tests at this point:
    1. Non-readable test. It's really hard for anybody to read and understand the intent of the test.
    2. Hard coded wait statements. Almost always a point of failure.
    3. The test data is hard coded in the test.
    4. Driver is tightly bound to this test. When we want to write more and more test, the same driver needs to be
        available to all those tests.
