Moving from saying

Select journey as one-way, enter origin as Bangalore, enter destination and Delhi, enter date as tomorrow
and click search
                            To
Search for a one-way journey from Bangalore to Delhi for tomorrow.

So basically, the business always talks of a journey in totality and things like origin, destination, dates etc are
only different attributes of the journey.

In other words, think of journey as a domain object.
Let us create a class called JourneyDetails that encapsulates things like whether it's one-way, source, destination,
travel dates etc. All these details are basically test data and the mechanism of using them on a page (like selecting,
entering,clicking etc) doesn't need to be part of the scenario.

So from  a business language perspective, the scenario is all about searching for a journey with some valid details and
expecting a response for the same.

We have replicated the same using the JourneyDetails class in here.

Also notice the JourneyDetailsBuilder class, it is basically builiding the journey details object with some basic default
data and overriding the same with any specific test data needs that we might have.
