So lets create the page classes for scenarios that we have. The pages we have so far is
    LandingPage. (This is the page where the user lands when he launches the application)
    FlightSearchPage. (This is where the user enters flight details and then conduct a search)
    SearchResultsPage. (This is where the user asserts if search results appear as expected)


And all the methods that we had on the test scenario class  other than the actual test methods can be moved to one of
the above page classes.

The scenario would now use the services provided by these pages to complete a scenario.

Read the test scenario again. It is now completely modeled on the pages of the application, a more readable
representation of the test scenarios.

Look at the page classes. All of them have the following in common:
    A driver instance to do stuff on the page(enter,select,click etc)
    Methods that collate our test steps.
    Also, all the object identification(html id, xpath, linkname etc) at the moment is hard-coded into the methods.

Keeping the hard-coded object identification may cause maintainance issues at a later point. Think of a scenario when an
object id on the page is changed by a developer. That would need multiple changes on the pages for a hard-coded id.

Ideally, the hard-coded id's should be abstracted at a page level and all the methods should refer to the objects by a
much more recognizable name. This would help in
    1. Improving readability
    2. Maintainance ease because only the reference needs to change, the object names can still remain the same across
     all methods.



Also, look at the navigation between the pages. Every action on a page that would take the user to the a different
page is wrapped into a separate method and returns the next page class as appropriate. Hence, giving us control of the
application navigation.
